# Changelog

## Aug 3, 2017
* Fixed user nicknames not showing in new threads
* The "manageRoles" permission is no longer required to use commands on the inbox server.  
This can be configured with the `inboxServerPermission` config option.

## July 24, 2017
* Commands are now case-insensitive (so !close, !Close, and !CLOSE all work)
* The before/after prefixes in edit notifications are now the same length, making it easier to spot the edited part
* Non-ASCII names should now result in better channel names (not just "unknown")

## May 18, 2017
* Identical edits are now ignored
* New thread notification (with @ here ping) is now posted in the thread instead of the inbox server default channel
* Thread close notifications no longer ping the user who closed the thread
* Received attachments are now only linked once the bot has saved them (should fix embeds)
* Replies now use your nickname, if any
* Several messages are now ignored for thread creation ("ok", "thanks", and similar)
* Logs from !logs are now sorted in descending order (newest first)

## Feb 15, 2017
More info is now available at the beginning of modmail threads.

## Feb 10, 2017
Major rewrite. Includes anonymous replies (!ar), stability improvements, and server greeting feature.
